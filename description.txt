Reloadable Guns is a mod that changes the way bullet shooting guns work, by adding a reloading mechanic. (no this is not a nerf to ranged weapons), guns can shoot up a max amount of bullets before having to be reloaded via pressing a hotkey, after reloading your next shoot will do 200% more damage.
all gun weapons will also have a +12% damage increase as compromise.
the purpose of this mod is to make it so that there is more things to do as a gunslinger aside from holding right-click.
